# LoanFlow Robot Tests

Automated test framework for the **LoanFlow Application API** built with Robot Framework and Python.

The framework validates the full loan application lifecycle - submission, risk scoring, decision engine, and retrieval - against a self-contained mock environment that starts and stops with each test run. No external services or databases required.

## Goal

Provide a reliable, maintainable, and scalable test suite that:

- Validates business rules (approval thresholds, income ratios, employment-based scoring)
- Runs independently with no external dependencies (mock API + mock risk engine included)
- Is organized for growth - adding new test types (web UI, mobile, performance) requires no restructuring
- Is readable by developers with zero Robot Framework experience

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.14+
- pip

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run all API tests
python3 -m robot tests/api/

# Run by tag
python3 -m robot --include smoke tests/api/
python3 -m robot --include negative tests/api/

# Dry-run (syntax and import check, no execution)
python3 -m robot --dryrun tests/api/
```

Local test runs generate `output.xml`, `log.html`, and `report.html` in the project root by default.

In CI, `pull_request` and `push` runs execute linting plus Robot dry-run checks, while the full API suite is currently executed via `workflow_dispatch`.

| Test Case | Scenario | Expected Status | Risk Score |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| TC-01: Lifecycle + Notification | Submit valid application, verify approval and notification payload | `approved` | 70-100 |

```

**How scoring works:**
1. Application submitted -> API validates input via Pydantic model
2. API calls Risk Engine (`/score`) with income, amount, employment
3. Risk Engine calculates score: base 100, reduced by stepped `income_to_loan_ratio` penalties, then adjusted by employment weighting
4. Application API maps score + `income_to_loan_ratio` to a final status:
   - `approved` when score ≥ 70 and ratio ≥ 2.0
   - `pending` when score is 30-69, or when score ≥ 70 but ratio < 2.0
   - `rejected` when score < 30
5. Additional rule: unemployed applicants with `loan > 10,000` are auto-rejected

**Why mock?** 
Tests must be fast, deterministic, and independent. Real services introduce network latency, data state issues, and flaky failures. Mocks give us full control over every response.

**Mock lifecycle:**
- Test suites start the full mock environment with `Start Mock Servers`
- Each test resets the in-memory application store and notification log with `Reset Mock State`
- Test suites stop it with `Stop Mock Servers`
- The Risk Engine can also be stopped independently inside a test to simulate dependency failure

The local mock environment uses `localhost:8000` for the Application API and `localhost:9090` for the Risk Engine, so test runs may fail if those ports are already in use.

Successful API responses are returned as `ApplicationResponse` objects (or lists of them), while validation and lookup failures return the shared `ErrorResponse` contract.

## How to Add New Tests

### New API test scenario

1. Add a data generator method in `libraries/api/feature_name/data_generator_keywords.py`
2. Use it in a `.robot` test file under `tests/api/`

### New API domain (e.g., credit score)

1. Create `libraries/api/credit_score/` with domain-specific keywords
2. Create `tests/api/credit_score_tests.robot`
3. Shared keywords (`response_keywords.py`, `base_api_client.py`) are already available

### New test type (e.g., web UI)

1. Create `libraries/web/pages/` for Page Object Model classes
2. Create `resources/web/keywords/` for composite `.robot` keywords
3. Create `tests/web/` for test suites
4. Structure mirrors `api/` - shared libraries remain in `libraries/shared/`

---

## Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| robotframework | 7.0.1 | Test framework |
| requests | 2.31.0 | HTTP client for API calls |
| fastapi | 0.104.1 | Mock Application API |
| uvicorn | 0.24.0 | ASGI server for FastAPI |
| pydantic | (via fastapi) | Request/response model validation |

The Risk Engine mock uses Python's standard-library `http.server`, so no separate mock-server package is required.

## Architecture

The framework follows a **layered, test-type-separated** architecture:

- **`tests/`** - Test suites grouped by type (`api/`, future `web/`, `mobile/`, `performance/`)
- **`resources/shared/`** - Variables reusable across all test types
- **`resources/{type}/`** - Type-specific variables (endpoints, locators) and RF keywords
- **`libraries/shared/`** - Python keyword libraries shared across test types (HTTP status checks, mock servers)
- **`libraries/{type}/`** - Type-specific Python keyword libraries
- **`core/`** - Pure Python (no RF dependency) - Pydantic models, validators
- **`mocks/`** - FastAPI mock API + Python HTTP mock server for risk engine

To add a new test type (e.g., `mobile`), create `tests/mobile/`, `resources/mobile/`, `libraries/mobile/` following the same pattern.

## What I Would Add With More Time

- **Parallel execution readiness** - Prepare the framework for safe parallel runs by removing shared mutable state and isolating mock lifecycle management.
- **Deterministic test isolation** - Centralize reset of in-memory state, time-dependent behavior, and generated identifiers so every test remains fully independent and repeatable.
- **Contract-first mock design** - Validate requests and responses against the OpenAPI contract to reduce drift between the mock environment and the real service.
- **Containerized execution model** - Package the mock API and Risk Engine into a reproducible local/CI environment to eliminate machine-specific differences.
- **Observability and diagnostics** - Add structured logging and clearer failure diagnostics for mock-server startup, downstream dependency failures, and asynchronous notification flows.
